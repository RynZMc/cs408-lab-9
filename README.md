# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This program is a simple game that the user can play. You play as an evil circle
and eat up the colored balls that are roaming around on the screen. 

To run, simply open a live preview of the index.html file. Copy the link and open it in a browser.
 - For the original version with simplistic movement, use src ogmain.js
 - For the improved version with better movement, use main.js
